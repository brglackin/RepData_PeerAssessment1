# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r echo = TRUE}
data<-read.csv("data/activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r echo = TRUE}
totalStepsByDate<-aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum,na.rm=T)
hist(totalStepsByDate$steps)

mean(totalStepsByDate$steps, na.rm=T)
median(totalStepsByDate$steps, na.rm=T)

```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
